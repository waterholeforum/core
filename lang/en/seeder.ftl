  Welcome to the community, and thanks for joining us! We want everyone to get the most out of of this community, so we ask that you please read and follow these guidelines.

  - **Be civil.** This is a place to share knowledge and interests through conversation. Be kind, patient, and respectful towards everyone, including people outside of the Waterhole community.

  - **No personal attacks.** Criticizing ideas, by means of reasoned arguments, is an important part of what we're doing here. But it's not okay for that to devolve into personal attacks. Harassment and other exclusionary behavior are never acceptable.

  - **Assume good faith.** When there is disagreement, try to understand why, always assuming good intentions. Remember that different people have different perspectives on issues, and that's okay.
